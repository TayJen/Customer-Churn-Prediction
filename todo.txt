Done:
    - Check the kmeans+svm+smote model for overfitting
        Answer: There are no overfitting, in order to verify additional test split was made
    - Finish SHAP for kmeans-svm-smote
        Answer: There are different issues with using SHAP with SVM, so we will catch it later
    - Try other oversampling techniques (first read everything in three last articles)
        Answer: 
    - Try logistic regression with best sampling technique
    -- MLFlow

Read and try:
    - Hyperparameter tuning (with MLFLOW?)
    - Feature selection based on SHAP conclusions
    - Different feature selection techniques
    - Other models such as Lightgbm, Catboost?
    - Cleaning the code
    - Putting everything into Docker
    - Dealling with dependencies (why tf is there PyQt5 in requirements?)
