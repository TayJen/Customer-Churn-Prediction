Near:
- Check the kmeans+svm+smote model for overfitting
- Try other oversampling techniques (first read everything in three last articles)
- Read oversampling and why SMOTE is bad, how to interpret it, and about other sampling techniques
- Finish SHAP for kmeans-svm-smote
- Perform feature selection based on SHAP conclusions
- Try logistic regression with best sampling technique

Far:
- Try other models such as KNNeighboursClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, XGB, Lightgbm, Catboost?
- Clean the code
- Put everything into Docker
- Deal with dependencies (why tf is there PyQt5 in requirements?)
