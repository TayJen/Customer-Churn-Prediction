Done:
    - Check the kmeans+svm+smote model for overfitting
        Answer: There are no overfitting, in order to verify additional test split was made
    - Finish SHAP for kmeans-svm-smote
        Answer: There are different issues with using SHAP with SVM, so we will catch it later
    - Try other oversampling techniques (first read everything in three last articles)
        Answer: 
    - Try logistic regression with best sampling technique


Near:
- Read oversampling and why SMOTE is bad, how to interpret it, and about other sampling techniques
- Perform feature selection based on SHAP conclusions
- Try different feature selection techniques

Far:
- Try other models such as KNNeighboursClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, XGB, Lightgbm, Catboost?
- Clean the code
- Put everything into Docker
- Deal with dependencies (why tf is there PyQt5 in requirements?)
